SUMA (SUrface MApping)
======================

.. _surface-based:

SUMA is a program that adds cortical surface based functional imaging analysis to the AFNI suite of programs http://afni.nimh.nih.gov . SUMA allows 3D cortical surface renderings, the mapping of volumetric data onto them and, surface based computations and statistical inferences.

.. _connectivity-data:

SUMA also allows display and manipulation of matrices for various flavors of connectivity data, tractography results from AFNI's FATCAT toolbox, and the rendering of volumetric data.
